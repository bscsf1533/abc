Vice Chancellor

The University of the Punjab enjoys a respectable position as a seat of learning amongst the reputed 
universities of the world on account of its rich cultural heritage and accessible opportunities being
 provided to a multitude of our youth for attaining quality education at an affordable cost.
It is indeed a matter of great satisfaction for me to note that significant improvement
 has been made in the sphere of imparting higher education at the University.
Innovative research in various new disciplines and new scientific courses has recently been 
introduced which will greatly help to cultivate an atmosphere essential for acquiring a high academic standard.
It is commendable that the University of the Punjab has created a modern infrastructure to make 
it possible for students to update their knowledge in various scientific disciplines since modern 
technology has become an essential vehicle of rapid progress. At the same time, the University has
 been quite successful in maintaining a balance between modern trends in education and its old traditions.
